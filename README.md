# In Kubernetes, each container can read and write to its own file system. But when a container is restarted, all data is lost. Therefore, containers that need to maintain state would store data in a persistent storage such as Network File System (NFS). Whatâ€™s already stored in NFS isn't deleted when a pod, which might contain one or more containers, is destroyed. Also, an NFS can be accessed from multiple pods at the same time, so an NFS can be used to share data between pods. 

# This behavior is really useful when containers or applications need to read configuration data from a single shared file system or when multiple containers need to read from and write data to a single shared file system.

# This workshop explains how to use File Storage (sometimes referred to as FSS) with Container Engine for Kubernetes and we will see how pods in different nodes share the same File Storage file system.
